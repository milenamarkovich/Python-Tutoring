Python Functions - Inputs, Outputs, Local vs. Global Variables
'''

'''
Exercise 1) Create a function with an arbitrary number of arguments. Print the functions arguments when you call your function.
'''
# Your code goes here!

'''
Exercise 2) Create a function that returns two values: the sum and the subtraction of 2 integers.
'''
# Your code goes here!

'''
Exercise 3) Create a function that has a default variable. For example, we want to print a student's name
and their grade. Set the default grade to 85.
'''
# Your code goes here!


'''
Exercise 4) Create a function within a function! Define an outer function to accept 2 parameters: a and b.
Then define an inner function which sums together parameters a & b. Add 5 to the result, and return final value
in your outer function.
'''
# Your code goes here!

'''
Exercise 5) Create a recursive function! A recursive function is a function that recurrently
calls on itself in a loop, until some breakout condition is satisfied. 
Define a function that calculates the factorial of an integer, n (i.e. n!). 
For example, if n=5, we want to calculate 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

'''
Exercise 6) Create a function that accepts any keyword arguments and prints
the key-value pairs
'''
# Your code goes here!

'''
Exercise 7) Define a global variable and set it equal to 10. Then create a function which modifies
the value of this global variable.
