# Exercise 1: Given a list, write a function which:
# 1. Accesses a certain index of the list and prints it,
# 2. Gets the length of the list and prints it, and 
# 3. Checks if the list is empty

def ex_1(my_list, i):
    # Your code here!
    pass

# Exercise 2: List manipulation: write a function which, given a list of length > 3, does the following:
# Changes Element: Change the second element of a list to 200 and print the updated list.
# Appends Element: Add 600 to the end of a list and print the new list.
# Inserts Element: Insert 300 at the third position (index 2) of a list and print the result.
# Removes Element (by value): Remove 600 from the list and print the list.
# Removes Element (by index): Remove the element at index 0 from the list print the list.

def ex_2(my_list):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Exercise 3: Write a function which prints the sum and average of all numbers in a list
def ex_3(my_list):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Exercise 4: Write a function which sorts a list - does your function sort the list in place, or make a new variable?

def ex_4(my_list):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Exercise 5: Write a function which removes duplicates from a list. Hint: Python sets automatically store only unique elements

def ex_5(my_list):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Exercise 6: Write a function which removes a certain value from a list.

def ex_6(my_list, val):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Exercise 7: Write a function which concatenates 2 lists index-wise. I.e. if we have 2 lists: list1 = ["M", "na", "i", "Ma"]
# list2 = ["y", "me", "s", "x"] the expected output would be ['My', 'name', 'is', 'Max']

def ex_7(list1, list2):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Exercise 8: Introduction to dictionaries - write a function that:
# Creates a dictionary with 'name', 'age' and 'city' and add values corresponding to your info
# Adds New Key-Value Pair: Add a new key-value pair, 'profession': 'Programmer', to the dictionary and print the updated dictionary.
# Modifies Value: Change the value of the age key to 20 in the dictionary and print the updated dictionary.
# Accesses Key: Print the value associated with the city key.

def ex_8(my_dict):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Exercise 9: Write a function that:
# Removes Key-Value Pair : Remove the profession key-value pair from the dictionary.
# Gets Items (Key-Value Pairs): Print all key-value pairs (items) in the dictionary.
# Checks if Key Exists in the dictionary

def ex_9(my_dict, key_to_check):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Exercise 10: Check if a value exists in a dictionary

def ex_10(my_dict, val):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Exercise 11: Create a tuple and repeat it 3 times. I.e. if your tuple = (a, b) then the expected output = (a, b, a, b, a, b)

def ex_11(my_tup):
    # Your code here
    pass
